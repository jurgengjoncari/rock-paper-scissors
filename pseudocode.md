As a player 
I want to have three buttons with the shapes 
so that when I click on a button I can choose a shape and play against the computer.

Design:
    * Have always title on top, center of the page that invites the user to choose a shape.
    * Have three buttons named rock, paper, scissors. The buttons have an icon or image in the shape of icons
    * The buttons are shaped hexagon and placed two and one below between them
    * The game starts when the user clicks a button
    * After every round, output the result after the previews one
    * When the game finishes, display the result near the bottom or a dialog.

Given that the game hasn't started, When I click a button, then the game starts, 

Given that I have clicked a button, the playerSelection is that button and the result is outputed

Given that it's the first round, When it's over, then Display the result.

Given that is not the last round, When a round is done, then the user has to choose a shape.

Given that the game has ended, When I restart the game, Then the results are cleared
